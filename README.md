What is the best movie you have ever watched? Is there a way to choose once and for all, which is the best movie ever made? With this project, we intend to shine a light into the darkness of reviews and find out what is the best movie ever, at least through the opinion of the most relevant film review sites on the net.

We started this project with a simple idea: is IMDB the cornerstone of the movie scores? Or is there a way to unify the opinions of the most famous film review sites available? 
With that in mind, we decided to get on a journey that was far from being a pleasure cruise along the Mediterranean coast and the Greek islands.
We had to extract the info available to us with the means that we could and so we scrapped the web, we called APIs and we cleaned data, lots of data, therefore lots of cleaning, but at the very end we achieved the goal, we got a database with the top 250 movies from IMDB but this time with the score data of the other websites. (That database has been uploaded to MongoDB btw, if you are interested).

So we had our data, clean and organised and all in the same place for us to be handled with determination and so we did. We got into the idea that perhaps most of the other sites got their scoring set out of IMDB, most of the data regarding film scores are very similar, and the ratings don't have great outliers, but the small differences between them were enough to let us achieve a new ranking of 250 movies that was, if not more accurate, at least more inclusive with other opinions.

And the results are clear, The Shawshank Redemption fell quite far from the top three leaving the top one available to the movie that has been, for a while, trying to nail down the first place in the best movies of all time: THE GODFATHER.
